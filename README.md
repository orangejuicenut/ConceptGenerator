first, run:
`pip install nltk`
then run:
`python concept-generator.py`

then deal with any of the errors, you might need to go into interactive mode and download some stuff for nltk. 


I made this in like 15 minutes lmao, maybe later I'll add features like specifying how many concepts you want. Maybe with something fancy like a parameter.
